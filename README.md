# trektracker
 
## Why:
Michelle needs a way to track what episodes/movies they've watched and what to watch next

## What:
Features include:
- user can mark content as consumed
- user-arranged viewing plan directs next episode/movie

## How:
Data can be sourced using [STAPI](https://github.com/cezarykluczynski/stapi)

### Back-end:
Debate between monolith using dotnet or node, or static site generator like gatsby

### Front-end:
This will be mostly determined by back-end architecture design choices but options include:
- vue
- react
- angular
- angularjs
- blazor
- nothing but js/typescript
